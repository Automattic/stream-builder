# MyAwesomeReader Example App

This is an example app of MyAwesomeReader implementing StreamBuilder.

In this example, we implement an endpoint for trending topics that uses a `Stream`, `StreamElement`, and a `Cursor`.

Usage is:

```shell
cd example
composer install
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in a browser to see the StreamBuilder example output!
